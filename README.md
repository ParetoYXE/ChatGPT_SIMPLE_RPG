# ChatGPT_SIMPLE_RPG
Simple RPG I created using chatgpt which I utilized to design class/function structure. Most errors were related to either assuming a class/function already existed for
the purpose ChatGPT wished to use. This was easy enough to solve by just asking it to generate the required function or class. The largest breaking issue or bug 
was related to logic or endless loops who's more abstracted nature in regards to the games function seemed to cause a handful of issues. These bugs were easily resolved by myself.
